# CatBot
A discord bot that sends the user cat pictures and facts on request. Currently, the bot won't send cat facts because the JSON data won't load properly at this time.

# Motivation
This bot was intended as a learning tool for creating a bot that responds on command and utilizing APIs. In order understand what I needed to implement, I equipped Python because of its simple syntax, and I wanted to use what I learned from my introduction to Python and intermediate Python courses in a unique way.

# Tech/framework used
